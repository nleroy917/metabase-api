# Metabase API Python Client
This is a Python client for the Metabase API. It is a work in progress and is not yet feature complete. I intend to add functions/api calls as I need them. If you need a specific function, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Hopefully, this package makes any scripts, functions, or applications that interact with Metabase a little easier to write and maintain.
